# E-Commerce-PostgreSQL-Project
Designing, implementing, and maintaining efficient and scalable database applications with PostgreSQL e-commerce data

### In this project, I'll be tackling: 
- Writing efficient SQL queries: Writing optimized queries to retrieve data from databases in the most efficient way possible. I'll be doingindexing, query optimization, and performance tuning.

- Structuring large datasets using partitioning: I'll be exploring partitioning techniques like range, list, and hash partitioning to break up large datasets into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will help me manage big datasets effectively and improve the performance and scalability of my database applications.

- Handling database errors: I'll be learning how to handle a wide variety of database errors, including techniques like logging, retrying, and rollback strategies. This will ensure that my database applications are reliable and robust, even in the face of errors and failures.

- Using design patterns for resiliency: I'll be incorporating design patterns that improve the resiliency of my database applications, such as circuit breaker, retry, and fallback patterns. These patterns will help me handle failures and keep my applications up and running smoothly, even in challenging situations.
